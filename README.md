# ChitChat
A lightweight, simple-to-use chat plugin that supports 1.16+ hex-based styling, tooltips, click commands and much more.

This plugin is **heavily** inspired by [DeluxeChat](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/deluxechat.1277/), and was built due DeluxeChat becoming abandoned (in its current state). This plugin was built as a plug-and-play solution to swap DeluxeChat for ChitChat. Due to this, the configuration file is near identical in-turn.

This plugin was built in a day as a fun, one-off project, and so features like Bungeecord support doesn't currently exist. Feel free to do a pull request if you wish to add these features, as I currently do not have the time to do so.

### Commands:
- /chitchat - Overall Usage
- /chitchat reload - Reload Config
- /chitchat formats - List Formats# ChitChat
